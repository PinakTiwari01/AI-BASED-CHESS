# AI-BASED-CHESS
 Creating an AI-based chess game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves integrating the game logic, graphical interface, and AI algorithms. Here's a brief description of how you can approach each aspect:  HTML Structure:  Use HTML to structure the layout of the chessboard and other interface elements such as buttons, messages, and score displays. Represent the chessboard as an 8x8 grid using HTML elements like <div>. CSS Styling:  Apply CSS styles to make the chessboard visually appealing and intuitive. Use CSS to define the appearance of chess pieces, squares, and other interface elements. Utilize CSS for responsive design to ensure the game looks good on various screen sizes. JavaScript for Game Logic:  Implement the chess game logic in JavaScript. Define the rules for legal moves, capturing pieces, check, checkmate, stalemate, castling, and pawn promotion. Manage the state of the game, including the current position of pieces and whose turn it is. Handle user input for moving pieces and validate the moves according to the rules of chess. AI Algorithms:  Integrate an AI algorithm to allow the computer to play against the player. Implement algorithms such as Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to determine the best move for the AI player. Adjust the AI difficulty level by controlling the depth of the search tree or other parameters. User Interaction:  Implement event listeners in JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as clicking on squares to move pieces. Update the game state and display after each move, including checking for game over conditions. Provide feedback to the user, such as displaying messages for check, checkmate, stalemate, or illegal moves. Optional Enhancements:  Add features like undo/redo functionality, highlighting legal moves, displaying captured pieces, or implementing a timer for each player. Improve the user experience with animations for piece movements or board updates. Include sound effects or music to enhance immersion. By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with AI algorithms, you can create a fully functional and engaging chess game that can be played in a web browser.
